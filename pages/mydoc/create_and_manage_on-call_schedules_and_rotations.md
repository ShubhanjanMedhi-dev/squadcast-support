In this documentation, we'll be going through the following :-

## Creating a Schedule

You can create a schedule under **Schedules** â†’ **+** button at the right hand side of the screen.

![](images/schedules_2.png)

**Schedule Name**: Give the schedule a name which you can use while adding the on-call schedule to the calendar.

**Schedule Description**: This is a short description of the schedule explaining what it is and why it exists. 

**Schedule Color**: You can also set a color for a specific schedule, which will be used while rendering the on-call on the calendar.

## Creating on-call person/squad for a schedule

You can click on any day of the calendar to create an on-call starting from that day. You can also drag from a day to another to automatically set the *Start date* and *End date*

*Start date*, *Start time*, *End date* and *End time* determine when the event begins and when it ends respectively. 
Every on-call must be a part of some pre-defined schedule. You need to choose which *schedule* you want to create an on-call for.

<b>Localized Timezones:</b>
<br/><br/><p>The selected timezone will default to the local machine timezone. This is especially beneficial for geography-based on-call rotations. <br/><br/>The teams will be able to view any created on-call schedule in their local time.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Repetitions can be daily, weekly or monthly. You can customize the number of days/weeks/months you want the on-call to repeat for. You can also restrict the schedules to specific times of the day or during specific days of the week, based on your need.
In case of weekly on-call, you can also customize on which day of the week it will repeat.

You can set an end date to the repetitions or you may choose to repeat it forever till you delete it.

### Creating a Recurring Schedule

**Recurring Schedules**

Typically, organizations ensure that their on-calls schedules are repetitive so teams can get used to them and the on-call shifts can be more predictable to avoid any surprises. 

These types of schedules have a list of users who will be rotated one after the other in a repetitive cycle. 

To setup a recurring schedule on Squadcast, you can just untick the `Does not repeat` box in the pop-up and complete the rest of the schedule configuration as per your need.

**Creating a One-off Schedule / Irregular Schedule**

One-off or non-recurring schedules are used to cover on-call for a short period of time but are not a part of the usual recurring rotations. 

In some one-off cases where one member of your team is asked to step in for another, cases where there's an unavoidable emergency or even in the case of planned vacations, you can create one-off  schedules. 

To setup a one-off schedule on Squadcast, you can just untick the `Does not repeat` box in the pop-up and complete the rest of the schedule configuration as per your need.
