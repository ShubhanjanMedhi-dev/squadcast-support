This is a setting that allows you to excuse users from getting alerts from Squadcast and instead forward it to someone else. 

This serves as Vacation Mode for when you are aware that you will be on leave for a certain period and can choose to forward your alerts to other team members. 

## Enable Alert Forwarding

Go over to the **Users** tab on the left panel, you can see a toggle against each user under the **Alert Forwarding** column

You can set the Alert Forwarding status for any particular user and select a replacement user (forward to) who will be contacted for any incidents in that time. You can choose to add multiple forwarding rules with the same parameters.

This ensures that critical alerts are not missed or delayed due to the engineer being super busy or away on holiday.
